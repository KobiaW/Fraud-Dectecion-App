This app predicts whether a transaction is Fraud or NOT Fraud
A comprehensive analysis of five Streamlit application deployment options (Streamlit Community Cloud, Heroku, AWS, Render, and Virtual Private Server (VPS)) was conducted, evaluating each based on features, costs, setup procedures, and suitability for various use cases.
The requirements.txt file is successfully updated to include all necessary Python libraries for the Streamlit application and the machine learning model, specifically adding pyngrok for tunnel creation.
All dependencies listed in the requirements.txt are confirmed to be successfully installed, ensuring the environment is ready for execution.
The successful deployment of the Streamlit app via ngrok provides a temporary public URL, which is ideal for testing, demonstration, or quick sharing.
